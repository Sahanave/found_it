# Building Generative AI Applications
## Prerequisite
Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) compatible with your operating system.

To use ElevenLabs, we need API key. Go to ElevenLabs and create an account. It's free! ðŸŽ‰. And in the upper right corner click on your profile picture > profile. Next click on the eye icon and copy/save your API key.

To use LLMs, we need API key(s). During demo we are using Azure OpenAI and AWS Bedrock models. Both require a separate subscription of a cloud provider. You can use OpenAI API or any other LLM provider, just remember to update the blocks in langflow.

## Local development
### Python related
We are using poetry to manage packages, and conda to manage python virtual environments

Follow this guide to install [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/)

Once you have conda installed, we can create a new venv on conda using
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
**Remember to keep the conda's environment.yml file clean, we keep dependencies on poetry.** If we need to upgrade python or poetry version - upgrade those in the `environment.yml` and recreate the environment.

We store the project python configuration in `pyproject.toml`
Especially python version
```yaml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.12"
```

Run below command to install all dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

Make sure the right python interpreter is selected

```bash
conda activate your_env_name
which python
poetry run which python
poetry shell
which python
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

## Running in Docker
To run langflow you need to have three containers minimum:
* langflow
* postgres
* streamlit-app

**streamlit-app** is a custom application, hence you will need to build it first.
```bash
cd app/
docker build -t streamlit-app .
```

First two container uses `.env` file, that can be copied from `.env.template`, and should be filled accordingly.

Run then the below command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
